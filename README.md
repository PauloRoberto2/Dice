# Dice
This project is my first interaction with graphical interfaces. Anyone who has any tips for passing me on about this would be very grateful. If you want to change from a 6-sided dice to a larger one, just edit the code in the {random.randint (1, 6)} part, put the value you want in place of 6. &lt;3
